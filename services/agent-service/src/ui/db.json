This integration enhances the factual consistency, relevance, and coherence of the generated text. The RAG pipeline is divided into pre-retrieval, retrieval using embedding models, generation with post-retrieval processing, and augmentation using multiple retrievals. Techniques like sentence window retrieval, which involves segmenting the corpus into overlapping sentence windows and scoring for query relevance, and auto merging retrieval, which combines relevant passages from multiple sources, support these enhancements. RAG emphasizes factual accuracy by grounding generated text in the retrieved context, ensuring relevance to the query, and minimizing redundant information, resulting in more accurate and coherent outputs.\n\n**Confidence Score**: 95"

This enhances language models' ability to handle specific queries, access specialized knowledge, and reduce hallucinations by grounding responses in actual data. RAG is particularly useful in applications such as question answering, summarization, and conversational AI where factual accuracy and detailed context are important.\n\n**Confidence Score**: 95"
