  "answer": "Query optimization techniques include heuristic-based optimization, cost-based optimization, join order optimization, indexing strategies, and materialized views. Cost-based optimization uses statistics to choose the best execution plan, while heuristic methods apply general rules like pushing selections early.",

  "answer": "Query optimization is mainly done using neural networks and reinforcement learning inside PostgreSQL. Every query is first converted into a decision tree and executed using an AI engine.",

    "Traditional query optimizers in relational databases use heuristic and cost-based approaches. Cost-based optimization considers multiple query plans and chooses the least expensive.",
    "Join ordering, use of indexes, and materialized views are some of the classical techniques."
