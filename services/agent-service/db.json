It covers both automatic evaluation and manual evaluation by providing human reviewers to assess the results provided through automatic evaluation.\n\nGiskard can be used to identify:\n\n1. Hallucinations: generated text that is not grounded in reality or factual information.\n2. Harmful responses: generated text that may be offensive, toxic, or hurtful.\n3. Legal issues: generated text that may raise legal concerns or violate laws and regulations.\n\nOverall, Giskard seems to be a robust evaluation framework for assessing the performance and safety of language models."
