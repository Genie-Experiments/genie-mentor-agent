The term \"agentic\" comes from the concept of agency, which refers to the ability to act independently and make choices.\n\nAgentic AI systems are designed to be proactive, autonomous, and goal-directed, meaning they can:\n\n1. Set goals and priorities\n2. Make decisions based on their objectives\n3. Take actions to achieve their goals\n4. Adapt to changing circumstances\n\nAgentic AI can be applied to various domains, such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, smart homes, and more. It's an active area of research, and its development has the potential to enable more sophisticated and autonomous AI systems.\n\nWould you like to know more about a specific aspect of agentic AI?"
